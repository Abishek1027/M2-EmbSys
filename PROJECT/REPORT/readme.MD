# LEARNING REPORT SUMMARY


### PROBLEM STATEMENT

- Overflowing of street dustbin create the unhygienic environment and also prone to spreading diseases.

### EXISTING SYSTEM

- The existing garbage bins a manually opened and closed there is no indication for garbage level so the garbage is collected after it overflows. Because there is no sensors the garbage bin will always be opened.

### PROPOSSED SYSTEM
- In the proposed system the garbage bin is automated with various sensors and actuators to sense the level of bin and close the bin to avoid overflow. At the same time the bin only opens when a person come close to it. Remaining time the bin will be closed. The level of the bin is transmitted to the end user to identify the level. By this we can achieve the solution for the problem statement.

## AUTOMATED GARBAGE BIN SYSTEM

### INTRODUCTION

- Automated garbage system is a project proposed to solve the garbage overflow problem on streets.

- In order to overcome the problem this project is designed with sensors, actuators, GPIOâ€™s, serial communication protocols, LED display and power supply unit.

- This setup works together and to automate the garbage bin and avoid the overflow of garbage on streets.
____________________
### APPLICATION 

- The door of the garbage bin will close automatically when it is filled

- The rain sensor senses the rain drops and close the garbage when it rains

- The dustbin doors will open automatically when a person come near the bin so that the door will be closed in the remaining time.

- This system will send the data through Bluetooth to the end system.

- It enables the remote monitoring.

### FEATURES

- Over flow of garbage is controlled along the streets

- Easily monitored

- Environment hygiene is improved
