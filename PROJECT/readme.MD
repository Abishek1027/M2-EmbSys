# 1. PATIENT MONITORING SYSTEM

## 1.1 ABSTRACT
-	Healthcare automation ensures support to the patient and eliminates the need of a caretaker near the patient. This project is based on Internet of Things and connects electronic devices to a public or private cloud to capture or monitor data and enables them to automatically trigger certain events. This project proposes automation techniques in healthcare such as heart beat rate monitor, pill bottle and drips bottle remainder, electronic paralysis patient caretaker. These automation devices are used to monitor patient health remotely using sensors and mobile communication devices.  These devices are known as the Internet of things for medical devices or IoT-MD.

## 1.2 FEATURES
-	The proposed system uses heart beat sensor that allows detecting the heart rate of a person even if the person is at home and transmits the heart rate readings over Internet.
-	Paralysis people in most cases are not able to convey their fundamental needs as they are unable to speak clearly. In such a situation, this system helps the disabled person to show hand gestures which in turn will display the need of the patient on a LCD screen.
-	This project assists in reminding the patient to take their pills on time. The system uses a mechanical setup (DC Motor and a wheel to locomote the pill) with IR receiver to indicate the collection of pills.
- This system makes use of a Clinical level sensor which indicates the level of Glucose inside the drips bottle.


## 1.3 STATE OF ART
- This project suggests some automation techniques in healthcare such as Heart rate monitor, Paralysis Patient Healthcare, Pill remainder, Drips bottle automation. Healthcare automation ensures proper support to the patient. These automation devices are used to monitor patient health remotely using sensors, mobile communication devices, and actuators.

## 1.4 APPLICATION
- Continuously monitoring the heart rate of the patient.
-	Maintaining the drips bottle level.
-	Pills intake direction and assistance.
-	Gesture control gloves for emergency purpose.
