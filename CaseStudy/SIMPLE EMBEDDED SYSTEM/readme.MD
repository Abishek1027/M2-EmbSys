## 1.4 COMPONENT EXPLAINATION
### ARDUINO UNO 
- In this system arduino uno is used as the microcontroller it is used to collect the data and signals from the various sensors like **temperature sensor, humidity sensor, soil moisture sensor** and delivers the processed signals to the output devices and actuators like **motor, lcd display** .12V power supply is given to the controller.
### TEMPERTURE SENSOR 
- Temperature sensor is used to scense the temperature of the surrounding and it gives the data to the controller
### SOIL MOISTURE SENSOR
- This sensor is used to scense the moisture content in the soil and then transmitts the data to the controller so that controller can decide about opening the sprinkler.
### LCD DISPLAY 
- LCD dispaly is used here to view the status of the system which indicates so many parameters as programmed.
### MOTORS FOR WHEELS
- Here the motor is used to rotate the wheels of the agrirobot so that this system can move over the fields and sprinkle the water.
### MOTORS FOR SPRINKLER
- Here we use another motor to open and close the sprinkler valve to sprinkle water and pesticides to the crops on the agri field
